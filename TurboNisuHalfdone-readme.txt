TurboNisuHalfdone 
Stock-a-Like Parts Pack
for Kerbal Space Program
=========================
This is just a quick and dirty update on TurboNisu's/A__Gun's work 
I've converted all textures to for the adapter and nose cap tanks to dds,
shuffled the tech tree placement around to put the various adapter and nose cap tanks in or near the same nodes as thier rough stock fuel tank equivalent so you don't have to branch all over the place to collect them all, 
and double checked and updated the config files for the KSP 1.04 heating and areo ballance to the best of my ability. 
All hail turbonisu the mighty creator and a__gun his chosen maintainer!... its late and I'm tired...

Oh and I didn't touch the landing legs or structural pieces so I didn't include them in the download if you are wondering why they are not here.

Parts update:

TurboNisuReloaded 1.1
Stock-a-Like Parts Pack
for Kerbal Space Program
=========================
KSP Version: 1.0+ (as this is purely a parts pack, it is unlikely compatibility will be broken)

Original works by TurboNisu, updated by A__Gun

Background
-------------
Back in 0.23 TurboNisu appeared with some great looking stock-a-like parts. Unfortunately he only ever made one update to the pack and with the more recent releases of KSP some of the properties of the parts became unbalanced. Not wanting to let this pack fall into obscurity (And since TurboNisu generously licenced his parts in such a way as to allow redistribution), I have totally rebalanced every part in the pack to bring it in line with stock KSP 1.0.

All 15 parts TurboNisu created have had all of their properties balanced in line with stock KSP, including cost, mass and fuel capacity. I have also adjusted the names and descriptions of the parts, to attribute them to the companies already existing within the game (Rockomax etc).


Changes
-------------
+v1.1
-Categorized fuel tanks as FuelTank rather than Propulsion
-Max temperatures bought in line 1.0 values
-Entry costs bought in line 1.0 values
-Fuel levels bought in line 1.0 values (Think this only really affects the tiny tanks)
-Attachment nodes fixed
-Added bulkhead profiles for sorting

Installation
-------------
To install, simply copy the 'TurboNisuReloaded' folder into your KSP gameData folder. To uninstall, just delete the folder again.

To update from an old version just copy and paste over the files (no names have changed so this should be fine)
