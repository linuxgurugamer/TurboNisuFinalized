for Kerbal Space Program
=========================
KSP Version: 1.0+ (as this is purely a parts pack, it is unlikely compatibility will be broken)

Background
-------------
Back in 0.23 TurboNisu appeared with some great looking stock-a-like parts. Unfortunately he only ever made one update to the pack and with the more recent releases of KSP some of the properties of the parts became unbalanced. Not wanting to let this pack fall into obscurity (And since TurboNisu generously licenced his parts in such a way as to allow redistribution), I have totally rebalanced every part in the pack to bring it in line with stock KSP 1.0.

All 15 parts TurboNisu created have had all of their properties balanced in line with stock KSP, including cost, mass and fuel capacity. I have also adjusted the names and descriptions of the parts, to attribute them to the companies already existing within the game (Rockomax etc).


Changes
-------------
+v1.1
-Categorized fuel tanks as FuelTank rather than Propulsion
-Max temperatures bought in line 1.0 values
-Entry costs bought in line 1.0 values
-Fuel levels bought in line 1.0 values (Think this only really affects the tiny tanks)
-Attachment nodes fixed
-Added bulkhead profiles for sorting

Installation
-------------
To install, simply copy the 'TurboNisuReloaded' folder into your KSP gameData folder. To uninstall, just delete the folder again.

To update from an old version just copy and paste over the files (no names have changed so this should be fine)
